### Distance

Distance between centers of the suns. Value ranges from 0 to 1 and the maximum distance is limited in order to maintain
realistic lighting in `Eevee` render engine. 

### Phase

A phase is one part of a cycle that goes in a circle. Using this parameter you can rotate `Binary Sun` around the `Sun`.

### Angular Diameter

Angular measurement describing how large a sphere appears from a given point of view. This is a way to control `Sun Disc`
size in the sky.

<!-- When increased it changes the sun lamp Angle value and makes shadows more soft. -->

### Temperature K

Changes the color of the sun disk. Bigger the value, bluer the sun. In theory small stars are hotter, thus bluer,
and big stars colder - redder.

### Intensity

Binary Sun radiance intensity in Watt·sr/m². Influences brightness of the sun disk.
