There is no _The One_ way to use this addon. That is why we encourage you to find the way
it works best for you. Addon [preferences panel](img/UI/UI_preferences.png) is located under
`Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.

### Toolbar Enabled
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `true`

By default, the _Atmosphere_ tab is in the sidebar of Blender 3D viewport (`N` key) and "World Properties" tab in
Properties panel. Setting this to `false` will hide the toolbar. Reveal panel by clicking on _Atmosphere_ tab. 

### Toolbar Label
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `"Atmosphere"`

By default, Toolbar tab for _Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ is _Atmosphere_. It might be useful to rename it
to something shorter like `PSA` to reduce space the tab is taking. 

### Use ACES color space
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

The Academy Color Encoding System[^1] (ACES) is a color image encoding system created by hundreds of industry professionals. ACES allows for a fully encompassing color accurate workflow, with seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of source.


### Use real world physical values
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

By default, addon reduces `atmosphere`, `sun` and `stars` intensity values to get the feeling _it just works_, and you 
don't have to modify extra parameter `Exposure` in order to get realistic atmosphere. But very important part of this 
addon is having real world physical values to support visual consistency.
